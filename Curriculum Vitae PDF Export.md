    - Architected & implemented the Onboarding component of the ARIES system, for automated data onboarding, reduced time to acquire and expose data and cost of this process by orders of magnitude by completely automating data retrieval from vendors, and exposing this data to PM teams.
	- Implemented a Rust interface for streaming data out of Rust for consumption in Python using PyO3, which improved performance of the system by orders of magnitude.
	- Rearchitected our Worker Pod management system, which improved the system's ability to provision k8s pods for background work significantly, by avoiding pod spinup/spindown costs.
	- Split a monolithic application in two - to minimise contagion / risk. Included provisioning of new infrastructure & deployment methodologies, new FE architecture, etc.

#### Globality (July 2020 - Sept 2022)

Globality is a San Fran based unicorn, endeavouring to build a service procurement marketplace powered by AI/NLP. I was an early joiner of the London office.

#### Aerosud Aviation (Late 2015 - Early 2016)

I employed as a junior engineer on the AHRLAC project during its design & testing phase, undertaken by Aerosud Aviation and the Paramount Group. This was to be South Africa's first homegrown fighter aircraft, spearheaded by the same engineers that built the Rooivalk helicopter.

##### Roles + Responsibilities

* **Junior Avionic Engineer**:
	- **Aircraft Avionics**: I was responsible for building a telemetry system that helped facilitate reliable reception of sensory data during flight tests.  This was accomplishing by building a tracking pedestal coupled with a bipolar antenna and bidirectional telemetric communication system.  The telemetry system was built using FPGAs and custom-designed microelectronics programmed in C.  The system tracked the aircraft in a range of up to 130kms (displacement) and up to 16000ft in altitude, with an error of 6 degrees.
