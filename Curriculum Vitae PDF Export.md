#### Globality (July 2020 - Present)

Globality is a San Fran based unicorn, endeavouring to build a service procurement marketplace powered by AI/NLP. I was an early joiner of the rapidly growing London office.

##### Roles + Responsibilities

* **Technical**:
  - **London Feature Engineering**: I'm currently an engineer in the London Feature Engineering Team. We handle a lot of the "core business logic" style problems on the platform. The team maintains fundamental business problems, processes and models associated. Most of my time thus far has been spent re-engineering the part of the platform that handles user authorisation.

* **Non Technical**:
  - Outside of "strict" engineering disciplines, I'm heavily involved in some more strategic/process aspects, such as:
	- Interviewing: I've been lucky enough to be able to step in and lead a few of our interview rounds, which is something I really enjoy doing - as well as teaching other engineers to do.
	- RCA review committee: I care quite a lot about learning from mistakes, and this is a process I have worked hard to revamp at Globality. As such, I'm part of the group of preliminary reviewers of any and all RCAs that arise.

##### Roles + Responsibilities

* **Technical**:
  - **Connect Team**: I was part of the Connect Team - which was responsible for a remit known as the Developer Platform. GoCardless has many external partners connecting to its service - and all things integrator<->GC was what this team of 6 took care of. Notably:
	- Instalment Schedules implementation
	- Lead platform migration from ES5 to ES7
	- Lead smart, credit-based refund initiative

#### ZappiStore (2016 - June 2019)

For three years I worked at [ZappiStore](www.zappi.io), a London based tech company, in the business of automating market research.

##### Roles + Responsibilities

* **Technical**:
	- **Performance team**: Focused on improving performance of platform, more than halved the load times of the main reporting platform functions.  Have given talks about some of this work @ conferences/meetups.
	- **Internationalisation Team**: Lead developer on a project that involved automating the provision of translations to survey responses for clients to and from languages of their choosing through an external provider.
	- **Sampling Team**: Lead developer on various projects relating to sample acquisition and management thereof.

* **Non Technical**:
	- **Technical Interviewer**: I acted as a technical interviewer for ZappiStore, interviewing candidates for engineering positions.
	- **Cultural Interviewer**: I wrote our company handbook, which is used as a reference and introduction for new joiners and employees.  As such, I was involved in phase 2 of many interviews, which was focused on assessing cultural fit of candidates.
	- **Onboarding**: I crafted a lot of our training material for developers, which has been used to help get junior/senior devs alike up to speed on the company's tech stack.

#### Offerzen Make (2017-2019, Part Time)

I acted as a 'Make Master', a developer coach if you will, for the Make Days hosted by [OfferZen](www.offerzen.com).  These are day-long courses on varying topics (AR, NLP, IoT) that help developers learn something new and encourage creativity.

##### Roles + Responsibilities

* **Make Master**:
	- Assist in creation of Make Day Course Material
	- Coach/teach/help developers during the make days

#### Aerosud Aviation (Late 2015 - Early 2016)

I employed as a junior engineer on the AHRLAC project during its design & testing phase, undertaken by Aerosud Aviation and the Paramount Group. This was to be South Africa's first homegrown fighter aircraft, spearheaded by the same engineers that built the Rooivalk helicopter.

##### Roles + Responsibilities

* **Junior Avionic Engineer**:
	- **Aircraft Avionics**: I was responsible for building a telemetry system that helped facilitate reliable reception of sensory data during flight tests.  This was accomplishing by building a tracking pedestal coupled with a bipolar antenna and bidirectional telemetric communication system.  The telemetry system was built using FPGAs and custom-designed microelectronics programmed in C.  The system tracked the aircraft in a range of up to 130kms (displacement) and up to 16000ft in altitude, with an error of 6 degrees.

### Education

* [University of Cape Town](http://www.uct.ac.za/), B.Sc. Eng. (Hons), Electrical + Computer Engineering:
	- Final Year Thesis Mark: 1st (75%+) - NeXtRAD Networked Tracking Pedestal Control System
	- Leadership: Deputy Head Student of University House (Resigned)
	- Course Representative for Computer Science, Physics


* [Michaelhouse](https://www.michaelhouse.org/), Matric
	- Marks Achieved: 6 Distinctions (English, Mathematics, Advanced Programme Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Computer Science, Engineering Design; 80%+), 2 Merits (French, Life Orientation; 70%+), nationally top 5% for English, Mathematics, Computer Science
	- Top 50 in South Africa, De Beers English Olympiad
	- Top 100 in Province, Mathematics Olympiad
	- Academic Honours, Community Service Colours
	- Toastmasters Society (2x Best Prepared Speaker), 1st Team Debating, 1st Team Waterpolo, 2nd Team Squash Gabriel Massey Award for Academic Excellence, Academic Student Leader

### Community Outreach

* **Post University**
	- Code4CT, course facilitator focusing on teaching girls from underprivileged backgrounds the fundamentals of computer science.  This happened on an ad-hoc basis depending on the organisation's needs.
	- Round Table, a non-political, non-denominational association of young men between the ages of 18 and 40 embracing representatives of nearly every profession and occupation, and whose objectives encompass the encouragement of high ethical standards. As a member of the CT9s, we endeavour to improve public welfare in the greater Cape Town area through a variety of community-based events, fundraisers etc.

* **University of Cape Town**
	- As a member of the surfing team/society, I helped facilitate outreach sessions every Friday/Saturday.  The aim of this was of course, to teach children from underprivileged backgrounds to surf, but moreover to be someone with whom they may discuss their aspirations, what studying at university is like etc. Children from poorer communities in South Africa benefit hugely from the opportunity to broaden their mind and improve social awareness, so that was the main focus.

* **Michaelhouse**
	- Peter Brown Award for Community Service: Endeavoured to provide a basic music department for one of the local rural schools - Crystal Springs Primary.  Featured in local newspapers.
	- SMILE Literacy Program, helping to improve the English literacy of Zulu speaking primary school children through reading/conversational exercises.

### Personal Projects & Extra Curricular

##### Personal Projects

*(It's worth noting, many of these are still WIP)*

- **Whismur**:
	- I built this because my mother was frustrated with the audio balance of David Attenborough's Planet Earth II (loud music, quiet narration).  It's an audio analysis library written in Python that attempts to classify a sound wave as music or speech using a variety of techniques:
		* Feature extraction (Mel-frequency cepstrum, Zero-crossover, Spectrogram Analysis, Chromatic Analysis)
		* K-NN Classification, Supervised Segmentation, Unsupervised Segmentation, Audio Regression Models
	- Using a Raspberry Pi with a microphone + transmitter, it tries to adjust volume on the television in realtime based on the characteristics of the sound waves emitted.

- **Theia**:
	- This was an experiment in Machine Vision, that used a simple SVM and linear regression written in Python to perform realtime vehicle detection.

- **Robbibot**:
	- A learn-it-myself experiment when I was interested in ActionCable and its inner workings, I built a lightweight chatbot for Slack that connected to a Raspberry Pi in the coffee shop down the road, so I could order things from the coffee shop by chatting to the bot on slack. Written in Ruby.

- **Mandala-Sphero**:
	- An experiment in IoT written in Javascript, whereby a simple HTML5 Mandala-drawing canvas was provided, input from the user was published to an AWS topic, and then read by a Raspberry Pi, which controlled n-Spheros. The end goal is to do long-exposure/time-lapse aerial photography of the n-Spheros developing a mandala that mimics the one the user drew.

#### Additional:

I'm a fairly active person, I row for Thames Rowing Club on Putney Embankment. If I'm not there, I'm on my bike cycling into the countryside.

- **Misc Certifications:**
	- PADI Certified Advanced Diver, RSM Gr3 Drums, VW Driving Academy High Performance and Defensive Driving Certifications, Shakers IBT Certification
